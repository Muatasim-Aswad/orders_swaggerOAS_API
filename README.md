This repository demonstrates how to document an API using Swagger/OpenAPI. The API allows users to manage orders, providing endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting orders.

## Introduction

This project is a simple demonstration of documenting an API using Swagger/OpenAPI. Swagger is a powerful tool that allows you to describe the structure of your APIs so that machines can read them. The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muatasim-Aswad/orders_swaggerOAS_API.git
   cd orders_swaggerOAS_API
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Running the API

To start the API server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Accessing Swagger UI

Swagger UI provides a visual interface to interact with the API. Once the API is running, you can access Swagger UI at:

```
http://localhost:3000/api-docs
```

## API Endpoints

The following endpoints are available in the API:

- `GET /orders` - Retrieve a list of orders
- `GET /orders/{id}` - Retrieve a specific order by ID
- `POST /orders` - Create a new order
- `PUT /orders/{id}` - Update an existing order by ID
- `DELETE /orders/{id}` - Delete an order by ID

For detailed information on each endpoint, including parameters and responses, refer to the Swagger UI.
